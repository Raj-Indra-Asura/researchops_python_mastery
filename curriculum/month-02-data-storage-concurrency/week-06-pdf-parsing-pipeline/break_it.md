# Break It — Week 06 PDF Parsing Pipeline

## Purpose of failure practice

Week 6 failures are about making ingestion trustworthy when real PDFs are messy. A user may give ResearchOps a corrupt file, a scanned PDF with no embedded text, a directory that does not exist, or a duplicate paper. The platform should not pretend those cases are successes, and it should not crash the whole batch when one file fails.

These labs teach you to inspect parser errors, convert them into useful `FailedDocument` records, and keep successful papers moving through the pipeline. A good ingestion system is not one that never sees errors; it is one that preserves enough information to recover from them.

## Failure lab rules

1. Use small fixture files or files created inside a pytest `tmp_path` fixture for experiments.
2. Break one pipeline stage at a time: discovery, parsing, metadata extraction, cleaning, saving, or failure recording.
3. Capture the exact exception type before wrapping it in a ResearchOps error.
4. After a failed parse, verify that successful files in the same run still succeed.
5. After a recorded failure, inspect `FailedDocument.error_type`, `error_message`, and `source_path`.
6. Do not add Week 8 parallel workers or later features while debugging Week 6.

## Intentional break experiments

Work through the scenarios below one at a time. Each one asks you to cause a failure, inspect what happened, fix it, and name the test or check that should catch it in ResearchOps.

---

## Scenario 1 — A file that is not a PDF

**Setup:** Create a plain text file named `fake.pdf` with contents `"This is just text."`.

**Break it:** Pass it to `parse_pdf(Path("fake.pdf"))`.

**What to observe:**
- `pypdf` will open the file.
- It may either raise an exception immediately or produce a `PdfReader` with 0 pages and empty text.
- Print the exact exception type and message.

**Expected behavior in your implementation:**
`ParsingError` should be raised with a message that includes the file path.

**Discuss:** Should you detect the non-PDF file before calling `pypdf`, or let `pypdf` detect it?
What are the tradeoffs?

---

## Scenario 2 — Zero-byte PDF

**Setup:**
```python
Path("empty.pdf").write_bytes(b"")
```

**Break it:** Call `parse_pdf(Path("empty.pdf"))`.

**What to observe:**
- `pypdf` will likely raise `PdfStreamError` or similar.
- Your code should catch this and raise `ParsingError`.

**Verify:** The `FailedDocument` error type should be `"ParsingError"`, not a raw `pypdf` exception.

---

## Scenario 3 — Image-only PDF (no embedded text)

**Setup:** Find or create a PDF that contains only scanned images.
(You can use any image converted to PDF, or find a scan online.)

**Break it:** Call `parse_pdf` on it.

**What to observe:**
- `page.extract_text()` returns `None` or `""` for every page.
- The full text after joining is empty.
- Your code should raise `EmptyDocumentError`.

**Discuss:** How would you handle this case if you had an OCR library available?
What would the fallback pipeline look like?

---

## Scenario 4 — Force a service-level failure after a successful parse

**Setup:** Create a fake parser that returns a valid `ParsedDocument`.
Create a fake repository whose `save()` method always raises `Exception("Database full")`.

**Break it:** Run `ingest_directory`.

**What to observe:**
- The parse succeeds.
- The save fails.
- Does the service record a `FailedDocument` for this case?
- What does `result.successes` contain?
- What does `result.failures` contain?

**Expected behavior:** The paper does not appear in successes.
The save failure should be handled (logged or recorded) without crashing the batch.

---

## Scenario 5 — Ingest the same directory twice with `skip_existing=False`

**Setup:** Ingest a directory of 3 PDFs.
After the first run, call `ingest_directory` on the same directory again with `skip_existing=False`.

**What to observe:**
- Your `save()` method will encounter duplicate `paper_id` values.
- `DuplicatePaperError` is raised.
- Does this crash the batch or just record failures?

**Expected behavior:** The duplicate check should convert `DuplicatePaperError` into a skip or a graceful log, not an unhandled crash.

---

## Scenario 6 — Ingest a directory that does not exist

**Setup:** Call `ingest_directory(Path("/tmp/nonexistent_xyz_folder"))`.

**What to observe:**
- The `find_pdfs` utility will likely raise `NotADirectoryError`.
- Check whether `ingest_directory` handles this or crashes.

**Expected behavior:** The service should catch this and return an empty `IngestionResult` or raise a clear error, not an unhandled exception.

---

## Scenario 7 — Very large text field

**Setup:** Create a `ParsedDocument` where `raw_text` is 10 MB of repeated characters.
Pass it through `clean_text`.
Try to save the resulting `Paper` to the repository.

**What to observe:**
- SQLite can store large `TEXT` values, but how does performance change?
- How long does the `save()` call take?
- How long does `list_all()` take when it loads papers with large text fields?

**Discuss:** Should you store the full text in the database, or only a truncated version?
What are the tradeoffs for search quality versus storage efficiency?

---

## Scenario 8 — Unicode in PDF metadata

**Setup:** Find or create a PDF with non-ASCII characters in its metadata:
- Title in Chinese or Japanese.
- Author name with accented characters.

**Break it:** Run `parse_pdf` and inspect `doc.metadata`.

**What to observe:**
- Does the title extract correctly?
- Does `extract_title` handle non-ASCII titles?
- Does round-tripping through SQLite preserve the Unicode correctly?

**Verify:** Save a paper with a non-ASCII title.
Load it back.
Assert the title is unchanged.

---

## Scenario 9 — Duplicate source paths

**Setup:** Ingest a directory.
Now rename one of the PDFs and ingest the directory again with `skip_existing=False`.

**What to observe:**
- The renamed file has a different path, so `PaperId.from_path` produces a different `id`.
- But the text content may be identical to the original file.
- Is there a way to detect this as a duplicate?

**Discuss:** The current design uses path-based IDs.
What would a content-based ID (`sha256_file`) do differently?
What are the tradeoffs?

---

## Scenario 10 — Parser that takes too long

**Setup:** Create a fake parser that sleeps for 5 seconds before returning a result.

```python
import time

class SlowParser:
    def parse(self, path):
        time.sleep(5)
        return ...
```

**Break it:** Run `ingest_directory` on a directory with 5 PDFs.

**What to observe:**
- Total time is approximately `5 × 5 = 25` seconds.
- The current sequential implementation has no timeout.
- If one PDF takes forever, the whole batch stalls.

**Discuss:** This is the motivation for Week 8 (multiprocessing).
How would you add a timeout per-file?
What Python tools support timeouts on function calls?

---

## Edge cases to explore

1. **Empty directory:** Run `ingest_directory` on an empty directory.
   Assert the result has zero successes, failures, and skipped.
   Assert no crash.

2. **Directory with only non-PDF files:** Put `.txt` and `.docx` files in the directory.
   Assert no PDFs are found.
   Assert no crash.

3. **Recursive vs non-recursive:** Put PDFs in a subdirectory.
   Run with `recursive=False`.
   Assert PDFs in subdirectories are not found.
   Run with `recursive=True`.
   Assert they are found.

4. **PDF with 0 pages:** Some corrupted PDFs have empty page lists.
   What does `for page in reader.pages` do with an empty list?
   Does `join([])` produce an empty string?
   Does your `EmptyDocumentError` trigger?

5. **Metadata with None values:** Some `reader.metadata` objects contain `None` for certain keys.
   Does your metadata extraction handle `None` values?
   Does `str(None)` produce `"None"` (the string)?
   Is that acceptable?

---

## Debugging checklist

- [ ] Does the path exist, and does it have a `.pdf` suffix?
- [ ] Does `pypdf.PdfReader` fail before page extraction starts?
- [ ] Does any page return `None` from `extract_text()`?
- [ ] Does the joined text become empty after extraction or cleaning?
- [ ] Does metadata contain `Title` or `Author`, or is the fallback being used?
- [ ] Does `IngestionService` record a `FailedDocument` instead of stopping the batch?
- [ ] Does the fake parser in the test match the path discovered by `find_pdfs`?
- [ ] After the fix, can one good PDF and one bad PDF be processed in the same run?

## Reflection after breaking

1. Which failure case was hardest to handle gracefully?
2. What information in `FailedDocument` was most useful for debugging?
3. Which edge case would be most likely to appear in real usage?
4. How would you extend the pipeline to handle a second PDF library as a fallback?
5. What would you add to the failure recording to make re-processing failures easier?
